  text1: "In a place in La Mancha2 , whose name I don't want to remember3, not long
    ago there lived a hidalgo (nobleman) with a lance in a shipyard, an old-fashioned
    adarga, a skinny roc\xEDn and a greyhound runner4. A pot of something more cow
    than ram, salpic\xF3n on most nights5, duels and quebrantos on Saturdays6, lantejas
    on Fridays7, some extra pigeon on Sundays8, consumed the three parts of his estate9.
    The rest of the time he wore a veiled sackcloth10 , fleece tights for the feasts,
    with his slippers of the same11 , and on weekdays he was honored with his finest
    vellor\xED12. He had a mistress in his house who was over forty and a niece who
    was not yet twenty, and a farm hand who saddled the donkey and took the pruning
    shears13. Our hidalgo was about fifty years old14. He was of stocky build, dry
    of flesh, wiry of face15 , a great early riser and a friend of hunting. They
    want to say that he had the nickname of \"Quijada\", or \"Quesada\", which in
    this there is some difference in the authors who write about this case, although
    by plausible conjecturesII it is understood that his name was \"Quijana \"III,
    16."
  text2: 'It is known, then, that this aforesaid nobleman, when he was idle -which
    were most of the year-, read books of chivalry with such fondness and pleasure,
    that he almost completely forgot the exercise of hunting and even the administration
    of his estate; and his curiosity and inattention in this17 became so great that
    he sold many acres of farmland to buy books of chivalry in which to read,18 and,
    thus, he took home as many of them as he could find; And, of all of them, none
    seemed to him as good as those composed by the famous Feliciano de Silva19, because
    the clarity of his prose and those intricate reasons of his seemed to him like
    pearls, and even more so when he came to read those requiebros and letters of
    challenges20, where in many parts he found written: "The reason of the unreason
    that is made to my reason, so weakens my reason, that I rightly complain of your
    fierceness "21. And also when he read: "The high heavens that of your divinity
    divinely with the stars fortify you and make you worthy of the merit that your
    greatness deserves...".'
  text3: "With these reasons, the poor gentleman lost his wits, and he was trying
    so hard to understand them and unravel their meaning that Aristotle himself would
    not be able to understand them, if he had been resurrected for that purpose alone.
    He was not very well with the wounds that don Belian\xEDs gave and received,
    because he imagined that, no matter how many great masters had cured him, he
    would not cease to have his face and his whole body full of scars and marks23.
    But, in spite of everything, he praised the author for finishing his book with
    the promise of that unending adventure, and many times he had the desire to take
    up his pen and finish it to the letter as promised therein24; and no doubt he
    would do it, and even go out with it25, if other greater and continuous thoughts
    did not hinder him. He often competed with the priest of his place, who was a
    learned man, a graduate of Cig\xFCenza,26 as to which had been the better knight:
    Palmer\xEDn de Ingalaterra or Amad\xEDs de Gaula;27 but Maese Nicol\xE1s, the
    barber of the same town,28 said that neither was equal to the Knight of Phoebus,
    and that if anyone could be compared to him it was Don Galaor, brother of Amad\xEDs
    de Gaula, because he had a very good condition for everything, that he was not
    a fussy knight, nor as tearful as his brother, and that in bravery he was not
    far behind him."
  text4: "In resolution, he became so engrossed in his lethargy that his nights were
    spent reading from light to light,30 and his days from murky to murky; and so,
    from too little sleep and too much reading, his brain dried up so that he lost
    his mind.31 He was filled with fantasy of all that he read in the books, as well
    as enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, quarrels, loves, storms
    and impossible nonsense. His imagination was filled with all that he read in
    the books, of enchantments as well as of quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds,
    wounds, quarrels, loves, storms and impossible absurdities; and he was so settled
    in his imagination that the whole machine of those dreamed inventionsVI that
    he read32 was true, that for him there was no other truer story in the world33.
    He said that the Cid Ruy D\xEDaz had been a very good knight, but that he had
    nothing to do with the Knight of the Fiery Sword, who with a single blow had
    split two fierce and enormous giants in two34. He was better off with Bernardo
    del Carpio, because at Roncesvalles he had killed Roland, the enchanted35, using
    the industry of Hercules, when he drowned Antaeus VII, the son of the Earth,
    in his arms36. He said much good of the giant Morgante, because, although he
    was of that gigantic generation, who are all proud and unmannerly, he alone was
    affable and well-bred37. But, above all, he was good with Reinaldos de Montalb\xE1n,
    and even more so when he saw him leave his castle and steal as many as he could
    find, and when he stole that idol of Mohammed that was all of gold, as his story
    says38. He would have given his mistress, and even his niece, to give a hand
    of kicks to the traitor of Galalon39.  "
